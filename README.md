Cloud Function Implementation Guide
Prerequisites
Before implementing the cloud function, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

Google Cloud Platform Account: You need to have access to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services.
Publisher and Subscriber Setup: Set up a Publisher and Subscriber for your Pub/Sub topic to trigger the cloud function.
Google Cloud Storage Bucket: Create a Google Cloud Storage bucket to store the cloud function code as a zip file.
Entry Point and Permissions: Define the entry point for your cloud function and ensure appropriate permissions are configured.
Implementation Steps
Trigger Setup:
When the VM starts and hits the POST method at http://poojacloud24.pw:8080/v1/user for user registration, it triggers the cloud function.
Cloud Function Configuration:
Write the cloud function using Node.js.
Utilize Pub/Sub to trigger the function.
Use Mailgun as the email provider to send an email to the user's email address.
User Verification:
Upon receiving the email, the user must verify their email address.
If verified, the user can perform update or display operations.
If not verified, the user is restricted from performing any methods.
Resending Verification Link:
Implement a mechanism to prevent users from sending repeated API calls to resend the verification link after initial registration.
Integration with MySQL Cloud Instances:
Utilize MySQL Cloud Instances with private IP addresses.
Use a VPC connector created on the cloud function to securely access the MySQL instances.
Conclusion
By following these steps, you can implement a cloud function on Google Cloud Platform to handle user registration, email verification, and integration with MySQL Cloud Instances efficiently. Ensure proper testing and monitoring of the cloud function for optimal performance and reliability.
